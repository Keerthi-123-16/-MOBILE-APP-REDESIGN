# DESCRIPTION 
              The Liceria Delivery App offers a visually appealing and intuitively designed user interface aimed at providing a smooth and efficient food delivery experience. From the moment users launch the app, they are greeted with a vibrant and inviting login screen, featuring a 3D animated delivery rider on a scooter, which effectively communicates the app’s core functionality—quick and reliable food delivery. The login interface allows users to enter their credentials using either an email or phone number along with a password. Users also have the option to recover their password through a dedicated "Forgot Password?" link, which leads to a minimalist reset screen requiring only an email to send reset instructions. For new users, the "Create Account" screen provides input fields for full name, email address, password, and confirmation password, alongside a checkbox to agree with terms and privacy policies. However, this screen includes minor spelling errors such as "Yoour" instead of "Your" and "Adress" instead of "Address," which should be corrected to maintain the professional quality of the app. Once logged in, users access a well-structured homepage that promotes food discovery through a search bar and featured cuisine categories such as Indian, Korean Sushi, Cheesy Pizza, and Brownies. The design is clean and modern, with bold images that make food items visually enticing. Each cuisine option is presented with high-quality images and easily clickable buttons, enhancing user interaction. When a food item like Cheesy Pizza is selected, the detail screen provides essential options such as “Add +,” a promotional “Free Coke” offer, “Buy Now,” and a final payment option labeled “PAY 299 > via.” These actions are clearly laid out, ensuring users can make decisions and complete orders quickly. The app’s use of soft green tones creates a calm and appealing aesthetic, while the consistent use of rounded buttons and subtle shadows contributes to a contemporary and tactile user experience. Typography is generally clean, but occasional inconsistencies in font size and alignment could be improved to elevate the app’s polish. The call-to-action buttons are well placed, encouraging users to engage without feeling overwhelmed. Overall, Liceria succeeds in combining function and form, offering an inviting, easy-to-navigate interface for users to explore various cuisines and place orders effortlessly. Minor refinements in spelling and text layout would further enhance the overall user experience and credibility. As a food delivery application, Liceria stands out with its attractive visuals, intuitive flow, and commitment to user-friendly design, making it a promising platform for anyone looking to enjoy a variety of delicious meals delivered right to their doorstep.
